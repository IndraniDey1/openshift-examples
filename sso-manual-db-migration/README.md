# Example of custom Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 TP CD configuration to perform manual migration of the existing Red Hat Single Sign-On database

This example illustrates custom configuration of the *_standalone-openshift.xml_* file to perform manual migration of the database used by previous version of the Red Hat Single Sign-On server to database format expected by the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 Continuous Delivery for OpenShift (Technology Preview) release stream.

For a step-by-step scenario on how to perform this migration, see the [Manual Database Migration](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on_continuous_delivery/7.3.0.cd03/html-single/red_hat_single_sign-on_for_openshift/#manual-db-migration) section of the [Red Hat Single Sign-On Continuous Delivery for OpenShift guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on_continuous_delivery/7.3.0.cd03/html-single/red_hat_single_sign-on_for_openshift/).
